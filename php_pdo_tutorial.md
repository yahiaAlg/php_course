# PHP PDO Tutorial for Beginners

## What is PDO and Why Should You Care?

Think of PDO (PHP Data Objects) as a universal translator for databases. Just as you might use Google Translate to communicate with someone who speaks a different language, PDO helps your PHP code communicate with different types of databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and others using the same set of commands.

Before PDO existed, developers had to learn different functions for each database type. If you wanted to switch from MySQL to PostgreSQL, you'd need to rewrite large portions of your code. PDO solves this problem by providing a consistent interface regardless of which database you're using.

## Setting Up Your First Database Connection

Let's start with the most fundamental concept: establishing a connection to your database. Think of this like dialing a phone number – you need the right number (server), the right credentials (username and password), and you need to specify which room you want to talk to (database name).

```php
<?php
try {
    // Database connection parameters
    $host = 'localhost';
    $dbname = 'my_database';
    $username = 'your_username';
    $password = 'your_password';
    
    // Create the connection string (DSN - Data Source Name)
    $dsn = "mysql:host=$host;dbname=$dbname;charset=utf8mb4";
    
    // Establish the connection
    $pdo = new PDO($dsn, $username, $password);
    
    // Set error mode to exceptions (this makes debugging easier)
    $pdo->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);
    
    echo "Connected successfully!";
} catch (PDOException $e) {
    echo "Connection failed: " . $e->getMessage();
}
?>
```

Let's break down what's happening here. The `$dsn` variable contains what we call a Data Source Name – it's like an address that tells PDO exactly where to find your database and how to connect to it. The `charset=utf8mb4` part ensures your database can handle special characters and emojis properly.

The `try-catch` block is crucial because database connections can fail for many reasons: wrong credentials, server down, network issues, etc. By wrapping our connection attempt in a try-catch block, we can handle these errors gracefully instead of letting our application crash.

## Understanding Prepared Statements

One of PDO's most powerful features is prepared statements. Imagine you're a chef who prepares a recipe template once, then fills in different ingredients each time you cook. Prepared statements work similarly – you create a SQL template once, then execute it multiple times with different data.

This approach has two major benefits: it's much faster for repeated queries, and it automatically protects against SQL injection attacks (a common security vulnerability).

```php
<?php
// Let's create a simple users table first
$createTable = "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
)";

$pdo->exec($createTable);

// Now let's prepare a statement to insert users
$insertStmt = $pdo->prepare("INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES (?, ?)");

// Execute the prepared statement with different data
$insertStmt->execute(['john_doe', 'john@example.com']);
$insertStmt->execute(['jane_smith', 'jane@example.com']);
$insertStmt->execute(['bob_wilson', 'bob@example.com']);

echo "Users inserted successfully!";
?>
```

Notice how we prepare the statement once with placeholders (`?`), then execute it multiple times with different values. The placeholders are automatically escaped, which means malicious code can't be injected into your database.

## Fetching Data: Different Ways to Retrieve Information

Once you have data in your database, you'll need to retrieve it. PDO provides several methods for fetching data, each suited for different situations. Let's explore the most common ones:

```php
<?php
// Fetch all users at once
$stmt = $pdo->query("SELECT * FROM users");
$allUsers = $stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);

echo "All users:\n";
foreach ($allUsers as $user) {
    echo "ID: {$user['id']}, Username: {$user['username']}, Email: {$user['email']}\n";
}

// Fetch one user at a time (useful for large datasets)
$stmt = $pdo->query("SELECT * FROM users");
echo "\nFetching one by one:\n";
while ($user = $stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)) {
    echo "Processing user: {$user['username']}\n";
}

// Fetch a specific user using prepared statement
$stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?");
$stmt->execute(['john_doe']);
$specificUser = $stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);

if ($specificUser) {
    echo "\nFound user: {$specificUser['username']} with email {$specificUser['email']}\n";
} else {
    echo "\nUser not found!\n";
}
?>
```

The `fetchAll()` method retrieves all results at once and stores them in an array. This is convenient for small datasets but can consume a lot of memory if you have thousands of records. The `fetch()` method retrieves one row at a time, which is more memory-efficient for large datasets.

The `PDO::FETCH_ASSOC` parameter tells PDO to return the data as an associative array where the keys are the column names. This makes your code more readable than using numeric indices.

## Working with Named Placeholders

While question mark placeholders (`?`) work well, named placeholders can make your code more readable, especially when dealing with complex queries with many parameters:

```php
<?php
// Using named placeholders makes the code more self-documenting
$stmt = $pdo->prepare("INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES (:username, :email)");
$stmt->execute([
    ':username' => 'alice_cooper',
    ':email' => 'alice@example.com'
]);

// You can also bind parameters one by one
$stmt = $pdo->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = :username AND email = :email");
$stmt->bindParam(':username', $searchUsername);
$stmt->bindParam(':email', $searchEmail);

$searchUsername = 'john_doe';
$searchEmail = 'john@example.com';
$stmt->execute();

$result = $stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
if ($result) {
    echo "Found matching user: {$result['username']}\n";
}
?>
```

Named placeholders are particularly useful when you have the same parameter appearing multiple times in a query, or when you want to make your code more self-documenting.

## Handling Errors Gracefully

Database operations can fail for various reasons: network issues, constraint violations, syntax errors, etc. Learning to handle these errors properly is crucial for building robust applications:

```php
<?php
try {
    // Let's try to insert a user that might violate constraints
    $stmt = $pdo->prepare("INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES (?, ?)");
    $stmt->execute(['john_doe', 'john@example.com']); // This might fail if username already exists
    
    echo "User inserted successfully!";
} catch (PDOException $e) {
    // Check if it's a duplicate entry error
    if ($e->getCode() == 23000) {
        echo "Error: Username or email already exists!";
    } else {
        echo "Database error: " . $e->getMessage();
    }
}

// You can also check if a query affected any rows
$stmt = $pdo->prepare("UPDATE users SET email = ? WHERE username = ?");
$stmt->execute(['newemail@example.com', 'nonexistent_user']);

$rowsAffected = $stmt->rowCount();
if ($rowsAffected > 0) {
    echo "Updated $rowsAffected user(s)";
} else {
    echo "No users were updated (user might not exist)";
}
?>
```

The `rowCount()` method tells you how many rows were affected by your last INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. This is useful for confirming that your operation actually did something.

## Transactions: Ensuring Data Consistency

Sometimes you need to perform multiple database operations that should either all succeed or all fail together. For example, when transferring money between bank accounts, you need to both subtract from one account and add to another – if either operation fails, neither should be completed.

```php
<?php
// Let's create a simple accounts table for demonstration
$createAccountsTable = "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS accounts (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT,
    balance DECIMAL(10,2) DEFAULT 0.00
)";
$pdo->exec($createAccountsTable);

// Insert some test accounts
$pdo->exec("INSERT INTO accounts (user_id, balance) VALUES (1, 1000.00), (2, 500.00)");

// Now let's transfer money using a transaction
try {
    $pdo->beginTransaction(); // Start the transaction
    
    // Subtract from account 1
    $stmt = $pdo->prepare("UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - ? WHERE user_id = ?");
    $stmt->execute([200.00, 1]);
    
    // Add to account 2
    $stmt = $pdo->prepare("UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + ? WHERE user_id = ?");
    $stmt->execute([200.00, 2]);
    
    // If we get here, both operations succeeded
    $pdo->commit(); // Make the changes permanent
    echo "Transfer completed successfully!";
    
} catch (PDOException $e) {
    // If anything went wrong, undo all changes
    $pdo->rollBack();
    echo "Transfer failed: " . $e->getMessage();
}
?>
```

Transactions ensure that your database remains in a consistent state even if something goes wrong in the middle of a complex operation. The `beginTransaction()` method starts a transaction, `commit()` makes all changes permanent, and `rollBack()` undoes all changes since the transaction began.

## Building a Simple User Management System

Let's put everything together by creating a simple but complete user management system that demonstrates real-world usage of PDO:

```php
<?php
class UserManager {
    private $pdo;
    
    public function __construct($pdo) {
        $this->pdo = $pdo;
    }
    
    public function createUser($username, $email) {
        try {
            $stmt = $this->pdo->prepare("INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES (?, ?)");
            $stmt->execute([$username, $email]);
            return $this->pdo->lastInsertId(); // Returns the ID of the newly created user
        } catch (PDOException $e) {
            throw new Exception("Could not create user: " . $e->getMessage());
        }
    }
    
    public function getUserById($id) {
        $stmt = $this->pdo->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?");
        $stmt->execute([$id]);
        return $stmt->fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
    }
    
    public function updateUser($id, $username, $email) {
        $stmt = $this->pdo->prepare("UPDATE users SET username = ?, email = ? WHERE id = ?");
        $stmt->execute([$username, $email, $id]);
        return $stmt->rowCount() > 0; // Returns true if user was updated
    }
    
    public function deleteUser($id) {
        $stmt = $this->pdo->prepare("DELETE FROM users WHERE id = ?");
        $stmt->execute([$id]);
        return $stmt->rowCount() > 0; // Returns true if user was deleted
    }
    
    public function getAllUsers() {
        $stmt = $this->pdo->query("SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY created_at DESC");
        return $stmt->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
    }
}

// Usage example
$userManager = new UserManager($pdo);

// Create a new user
$userId = $userManager->createUser('testuser', 'test@example.com');
echo "Created user with ID: $userId\n";

// Get the user
$user = $userManager->getUserById($userId);
echo "Retrieved user: {$user['username']}\n";

// Update the user
$updated = $userManager->updateUser($userId, 'updateduser', 'updated@example.com');
echo $updated ? "User updated successfully\n" : "User not found\n";

// Get all users
$allUsers = $userManager->getAllUsers();
echo "Total users: " . count($allUsers) . "\n";
?>
```

This example demonstrates how to organize your PDO code into a reusable class. Notice how each method has a single responsibility and handles errors appropriately. The `lastInsertId()` method is particularly useful – it returns the ID of the last inserted record, which you often need for further operations.

## Best Practices and Security Considerations

As you work with PDO, keep these important principles in mind:

**Always use prepared statements** when dealing with user input. Never concatenate user data directly into SQL strings, as this opens your application to SQL injection attacks.

**Handle errors gracefully** by using try-catch blocks around database operations. Your users should never see technical error messages – log them for debugging but show user-friendly messages.

**Use transactions** when you need to perform multiple related database operations. This ensures data consistency and makes your application more robust.

**Close connections properly** by setting your PDO object to null when you're done with it, although PHP will usually handle this automatically.

**Choose the right fetch method** for your needs. Use `fetchAll()` for small datasets that you need to process multiple times, and `fetch()` for large datasets or when you only need to process each row once.

Remember that learning PDO is like learning to drive – the concepts might seem overwhelming at first, but with practice, these patterns will become second nature. Start with simple operations like inserting and selecting data, then gradually work your way up to more complex scenarios involving transactions and error handling.

The key to mastering PDO is understanding that it's not just about writing code that works – it's about writing code that's secure, maintainable, and efficient. Take time to understand each concept thoroughly before moving on to the next one, and don't hesitate to experiment with the examples to see how they behave in different situations.
